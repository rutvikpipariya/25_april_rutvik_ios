Introduction And Fundamental of Swift :
==============================================

What is Swift?
-> Swift is a compiled programming language that is general-purpose, multi-paradigm and was developed by Apple Inc. It is available for multiple OS platforms such as iOS, iPadOS, macOS,
watchOS, tvOS, z/OS and also for Linux. Swift is primarily designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks along with a wide range of existing Objective-C code written 
for Apple products. Built with the open source LLVM compiler framework, Swift has been an inclusion in Xcode since version 6 that was released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it makes use 
of the Objective-C runtime library, thus allowing C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.Â
